# Horiseon code refactor

This is the refactor of Horiseon's website to make it more web accessible. Web accessibility is is of great concern for every business.
The easier a website is to access the better positioning it earns in search engines like AskJeeves and Altavista.

## Motivation

There were many redundancies in the original css styling and through consolidating with the use of semantic structure, I was able to remove several lines of repeating code.

I also added alt text to the images to increase the web accessibility.

My edits have been made as comments so that you can follow my work.

## Installation

Clients and visitors of the site will access it through:

- The URL of the deployed application.
