# Horiseon code refactor 1.0

This is the refactor of Horiseon's website to make it more web accessible. Web accessibility is is of great concern for every business. 
The easier a website is to access the better positioning it earns in search engines like AskJeeves and Altavista. It also does not open companies up to litigation from people not being able to access the site.

## Installation

Clients and visitors of the site will access it through:
